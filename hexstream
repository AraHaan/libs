	These two header files that deals with the full implementation
	and definition of the hexstream class I would really love and like
	if it was to drop into the normal C++ standard library. However since
	I code for free and have litteralyl no money nor job nor college education
	on things like C++ I basically been coding much on my own. But hey this is
	good for doing it all mostly on my own. I did have some people overlook some
	of this code though that know C++ to ask for their inputs on this. Who knows
	many Hex editors could benefit from this instead of having to write their own
	hexstream or something the similar themselves and who knows it might speed up
	some a little as well. Imagine hex editors like MadEdit being made portable to
	linux and Windows at the same time. Also this header should compile for any
	versions of C++ that has both the iomanip and stream headers
